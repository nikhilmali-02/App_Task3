# Task 3 - Backend Integration

This project is part of my Android App Development Internship.

In this task, I learned how to connect an Android app with a REST API and display the data inside the app.

## What I Did

- Added internet permission
- Used Retrofit library to call an API
- Fetched data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- Parsed JSON response using Gson
- Displayed the data in a RecyclerView

## How It Works

When the app starts, it makes an API call in the background.
If the response is successful, the list of post titles is shown on the screen.
If the API fails, it prints the error in Logcat.

## What I Learned

- How REST APIs work
- How to use Retrofit in Android
- How to handle asynchronous network calls
- How to use RecyclerView to show dynamic data

This task helped me understand backend integration in Android applications.
